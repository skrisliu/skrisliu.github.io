I am a data scientist, with special focus on remote sensing and machine learning (Earth Data Science).
I play with a variety of datasets from various domains, including 
- spectral and radar imagery to map the Earth's surface 
- satellite and low-cost ground sensors to estimate air pollution 
- imagery from panoramic, all-sky and satellite cameras and night sky brightness from sky quality meter (SQM) to analyze light pollution 
- MRI imagery to predict brain age and dementia 
- temperature data for temperature-related health outcomes

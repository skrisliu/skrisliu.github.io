I am a PhD student at University of Southern California. Prior to joining USC, I was a research assistant at The University of Hong Kong. I received my bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-Sen University. 

My research interests include remote sensing, machine learning, and urban climate. I develop advanced AI methods for processing Earth Observation data (AI4EO). I apply EO data for urban studies and climate research.

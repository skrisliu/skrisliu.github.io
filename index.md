I am a PhD student at [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu). My research interests include remote sensing, machine learning, and environment & sustainability. I develop advanced AI methods for processing Earth Observation data (AI4EO) and apply EO data for sustainability research. 

Prior to joining USC, I was a research assistant in light pollution at [The University of Hong Kong](https://hku.hk). I received my bachelor's degree from [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://sysu.edu.cn).

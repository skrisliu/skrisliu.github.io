I am a data scientist. I discover patterns from data. My past research involves using
- spectral and radar imagery to map the Earth's surface 
- satellite and weather station data to estimate air pollution 
- panoramic, all-sky and satellite imagery and sky quality meter data to identify light pollution 
- MRI imagery to predict brain age and dementia 
- thermal data to analyze temperature-health associations

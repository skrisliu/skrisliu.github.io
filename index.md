I am a PhD student at [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu). Prior to joining USC, I was a research assistant at [The University of Hong Kong](https://hku.hk). I received my bachelor's degree from [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://sysu.edu.cn). 

My research interests include remote sensing, machine learning, and urban climate. I develop advanced AI methods for processing Earth Observation data (AI4EO) and apply EO data for urban studies and climate research.
